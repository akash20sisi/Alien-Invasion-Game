This repository contains python code for the game called Alien Invasion!
We used Pygame, a collection of fun, powerful Python modules that manage graphics,
animation, and even sound, making it easier
for you to build sophisticated games. With Pygame
handling tasks like drawing images to the screen, you
can focus on the higher-level logic of game dynamics.
